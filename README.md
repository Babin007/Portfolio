# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## EmailJS setup (client-side email sending)

This project uses EmailJS for client-side email sending from the `Contact` form (no backend required). If you see an "Invalid Public Key" error, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to EmailJS: https://dashboard.emailjs.com/
2. Go to Account -> Integration (or Admin -> Account) to find your Public Key (it looks like `user_xxx...`).
3. Create a Service (SMTP provider) and a Template. In the Template, reference these fields: `from_name`, `from_email`, `message`. If you allow file attachments, name the file input `attachment` in the form (the component uses this name already).
4. Create a local environment file (do not commit it): copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and replace placeholders with your values:

```
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=service_xxx
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=template_xxx
REACT_APP_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=user_xxx
```

5. Restart the React dev server (so Create React App picks up the env vars):

```bash
npm start
```

Notes:
- Don't commit `.env.local` to version control. Keep the keys private.
- If you still get errors, confirm the Public Key on the EmailJS dashboard matches exactly, and double-check the Template ID and Service ID.
- EmailJS supports file uploads via `sendForm` â€” the component's file input is named `attachment` and is validated for a 5MB limit.
